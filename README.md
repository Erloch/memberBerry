This is a classic memory game using react for the front end functionality. In this game you get to choose from 10 random cards. With the first pick you set that card to be compaired to the next pick. after your first pick the cards are shuffled for a second choice. Your second pick will then be compaired to the first pick to see if they are the same.

If the cards are the same card those cards are removed from the choices. If the two cards are not the same card then they are flipped back over and you have to try again at picking matching cards. Enjoy!
